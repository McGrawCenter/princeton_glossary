# Princeton Wordpress Glossary

Princeton Wordpress glossary is a Wordpress plugin for the automatic glossing of text on a Wordpress site. Vocaulary items are entered in a publically published Google spreadsheet.  This plugin pulls the vocaulary data from that spreadsheet and glossed matching words on the site.
